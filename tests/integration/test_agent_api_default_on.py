"""Default-on containment (US-D1.1).

The Agent API server defaults to ON in production, so the test harness must keep
it disabled and the app's auto-start path must honour that — otherwise a full-app
test that pumps the event loop past the 1500 ms deferred start would bind a real
loopback port and hang. These tests are the positive proof that containment
holds (they fail loudly if the autouse guard regresses).
