## Case study: label editor auto-closing (fixed 2026-04-22)

**Symptom**: double-clicking any garden item opened the inline label editor for ~110 ms then it closed by itself.

**Theories entertained (wrong)**:
- Qt's double-click Release-2 event steals focus
- `_label_edit_start_time` set after `setFocus()` so guard evaluated stale `0.0`
- `super().focusOutEvent()` clears text cursor

**What instrumentation revealed** (one double-click, reading stdout):

```
[LABEL] _give_focus() — after setFocus: hasFocus=True  isVisible=True

[LABEL] focusOutEvent:
[LABEL]   elapsed        = 0.109000s
[LABEL]   isVisible()    = False          ← ALREADY HIDDEN before focusOut fired
[LABEL]   guard (<0.2s)  = False          ← guard missed because isVisible is False
[LABEL]   caller stack:
[LABEL]     minimap_widget.py:205 — item.setVisible(False)   ← THE CULPRIT
```

**Root cause**: `MinimapWidget._hide_overlay_items()` iterates all scene items with `ItemIgnoresTransformations` and calls `setVisible(False)` on them — including the `EditableLabel` — before rendering the minimap thumbnail (~110 ms after focus was given). Hiding the item fired `focusOutEvent` with `isVisible() = False`, so the time-based guard (which checks `isVisible()`) never activated.

**Fix** (one line in `minimap_widget.py`): skip the scene's current focus item in `_hide_overlay_items()`.

**Lesson**: the call stack in `focusOutEvent` pointed directly to the file and line number of the external caller. Without it, debugging would have required days of guessing.
