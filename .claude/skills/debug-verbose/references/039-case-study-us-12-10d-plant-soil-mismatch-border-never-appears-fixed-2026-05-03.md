## Case study: US-12.10d plant-soil mismatch border never appears (fixed 2026-05-03)

**Symptom**: Tomato in a bed with mismatched soil pH/N/P/K never triggered the amber/red bed border. `SoilService.get_mismatched_plants()` had a perfect implementation and 14 passing integration tests, yet the live app behaviour was silently broken. Manual hover tooltip showed *one* warning ("heavy N feeder") that never changed regardless of which soil parameters the user altered.

**Theories entertained (wrong)**:
- The 500 ms debounce timer wasn't firing — but the same timer correctly drove the rotation handle hide/show and badge updates.
- The `_child_item_ids` link from bed to plant was missing — verified, it was set correctly.
- `is_bed_type` rejecting the rectangle — false, the bed had `ObjectType.GARDEN_BED`.
- The pH rule had a bug in its boundary comparison — re-read it five times, the logic was right.
- The plant-data file (`planting_calendar.json`) lacked `n_demand` — true but not load-bearing; the legacy `nutrient_demand="heavy"` mapping covers it via `_effective_demand()`.

**What instrumentation revealed**: A diff between `PlantSpeciesData` dataclass field list and the keys returned by `to_dict()`:

```
fields:    ..., nutrient_demand, n_demand, p_demand, k_demand, raw_data
to_dict:   ..., nutrient_demand,                                raw_data    ← three missing
from_dict: ..., nutrient_demand=...,                            raw_data=...
```

Three brand-new fields were declared on the dataclass (US-12.10d) but never added to either serialization site. So the live data flow `library → plant_database_panel.set_plant_data() → metadata["plant_species"] = data.to_dict() → ... → PlantSpeciesData.from_dict(metadata["plant_species"])` silently dropped every per-nutrient demand value, leaving `n_demand=p_demand=k_demand=None` on the reconstructed spec. The N rule still fired via the `nutrient_demand="heavy"` legacy fallback in `_effective_demand`, but it now used the *fallback* mapping, not the direct field — and any test that set the direct fields would silently no-op.

**Root cause**: `models/plant_data.py:210` `to_dict` and `models/plant_data.py:275` `from_dict` — neither was updated when `n_demand`/`p_demand`/`k_demand` were added to the dataclass.

**Fix**: Add the three keys to both serialization sites. Add a regression test [tests/unit/test_plant_data_serialization.py](tests/unit/test_plant_data_serialization.py) that iterates over every `dataclasses.fields(PlantSpeciesData)` and asserts presence in `to_dict()` output, plus a full equality round-trip.

**Lesson**: When adding a field to a dataclass that already has `to_dict`/`from_dict` methods, **immediately grep for the dataclass name in the same file and update both serialization sites** — and write a `dataclasses.fields()`-driven round-trip test. The integration tests passed because they constructed `PlantSpeciesData` instances directly and never round-tripped through dict; the bug only surfaced on the canvas → metadata → canvas data path. **Construct-and-test is not the same as serialize-and-test.** Whenever a dataclass has both code paths, both must be exercised.
