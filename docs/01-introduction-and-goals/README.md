# 1. Introduction and Goals

## 1.1 Product Vision

Open Garden Planner is an open-source desktop application that enables home gardeners to create metrically accurate 2D plans of their property and garden. Unlike existing tools that are either expensive subscription-based software or imprecise visual-only planners, Open Garden Planner combines CAD-like precision with garden-specific features — all in a free, open-source package.

**For gardeners who value precision and modern tools while staying independent and valuing transparency. We garden with passion — and we want tools that match that passion.**

## 1.2 Goals

| Priority | Goal | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Metric Accuracy** | Allow users to plan with centimeter-level precision, not just visual approximation |
| 2 | **Rich Metadata** | Track plant species, varieties, planting dates, and growing requirements as first-class data |
| 3 | **No Lock-in** | Open-source with standard file formats (JSON project files, PNG/SVG export) |
| 4 | **Attractive UI** | Modern, polished interface that feels native to Windows, with lush illustrated graphics |
| 5 | **Extensible** | Architecture supports future 3D visualization, sun simulation, and community plugins |
| 6 | **Contributor-Friendly** | Clean architecture, comprehensive tests, and CI/CD to attract open source contributors |

## 1.3 Target Users

| Persona | Description | Primary Needs |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Precision Gardener** | Engineering-minded hobbyist who wants exact measurements and documentation | Metric accuracy, plant metadata, exportable plans |
| **Property Planner** | Homeowner planning landscaping changes, needs to communicate with contractors | Scale drawings, dimension annotations, image tracing |
| **Vegetable Gardener** | Plans crop rotation, bed layouts, and companion planting | Bed definitions, plant spacing, variety tracking |
